    "## Classic Army Diet Optimization Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The diet problem was one of the first optimization problems studied in the 1930s and 1940s. The problem was motivated by the Army's desire to minimize the cost of feeding GIs in the field while still providing a healthy diet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of foods, along with the nutrient information for each food and the cost per serving of each food, the objective of the diet problem is to select the number of servings of each food to purchase (and consume) so as to minimize the cost of the food while meeting the specified nutritional requirements. Typically, the nutritional requirements are expressed as a minimum and a maximum allowable level for each nutritional component. Other constraints such a minimum and/or maximum number of servings may be included to improve the quality of the menu.\n",
